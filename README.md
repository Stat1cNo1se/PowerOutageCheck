Power Outage Checking App

This app was written after experiencing a lot of power outages. This app isn't aimed to do something serious. It is made to see whether or not power outages will worsen by the end of 2027. This app is by no means efficient. It was written in a rush and I'll make changes later. Currently it only works on linux, but with a few tweeks it can work on windows. This app is designed to run 24/7 on a laptop.
